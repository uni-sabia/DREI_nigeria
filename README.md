# Visualization of perceived investment risks in Nigeria's Interconnected Mini-grid Market

This graph was created as a part of contribution to a publication titled, "De-risking Interconnected Solar Mini-grids Investments in Nigeria", commissioned by the UNDP and Energy Commission of Nigeria. 

The report, “De-risking Interconnected Solar Mini-grids (IMG) Investments in Nigeria”, is the first-in-kind effort to apply the UNDP’s De-risking Renewable Energy Investment (DREI) methodology in practice outside of utility scale. 

The data is collected by surveying direct stakeholders at all levels in Nigeria’s IMG market. The report provides 8 recommendations for policy and financial instruments that the Nigerian government must consider to up-scale private investments in Nigeria.
